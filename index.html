<h3>Bulls and Cows</h3>

  <p>Bulls and Cows is an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, 
  predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind.</p>
  
  <p>On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. 
  Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. 
  If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are "bulls", if on different positions, 
  they are "cows".</p>
  
  <p>The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game.</p>
